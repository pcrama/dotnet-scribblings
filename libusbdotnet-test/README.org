* Introduction

This started as a copy of the [[https://github.com/LibUsbDotNet/LibUsbDotNet/tree/master/src/Examples/][Read.Write Example]] from [[https://github.com/LibUsbDotNet/LibUsbDotNet][LibUsbDotNet]] to
experiment with USB devices and C#.  I also looked at [[https://github.com/LibUsbDotNet/LibUsbDotNet/tree/master/src/Test_Info][Test_Info]].

* Setup

Note that I use the alpha version of the library because I am browsing their
example code on the master branch and the examples do not compile with the
current released version 2.2.29.
#+begin_src shell :exports code
  dotnet new console -o libusbdotnet-test
  cd libusbdotnet-test
  dotnet add package LibUsbDotNet --version 3.0.48-alpha
#+end_src

Because I also want to experiment a bit with the linting tools:
#+begin_src shell :exports code
  dotnet add package Microsoft.CodeAnalysis.FxCopAnalyzers
  dotnet add package StyleCop.Analyzers
#+end_src
